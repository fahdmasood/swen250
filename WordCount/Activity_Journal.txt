SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
Python - WordCount

Name: Jon O'Brien

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time 01 30
Plan:
 To write the code, compile it often and ensure good coding
practices are used to regularly commit changes, etc.

Complete
Actual Time	2HH 15MM
Observations:
After much research about forgotten coding practices of python,
I completed the program.  I encountered problems with remembering
proper python syntax and whitespace rules, as well as the use of
vim for editing and compiling the python code.  One hard aspect
of this assignment was the correct use of the standard output for
the file name to be used by ritwc.py.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
