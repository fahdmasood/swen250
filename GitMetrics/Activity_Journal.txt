SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
Ruby - Git Repository Metrics

Name: Jon O'Brien

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	3HH 40MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

I will begin with separating out the number of commits.  I will
search line by line for the keyword "commit" then I will increment
a counter by 1 for every line that contains that keyword.  Next I 
will implement the method to count the number of authors, searching
for "Author: " and incrementing a counter for every unique instance
in the log.  Finally will be the number of days in development. I will
use the DateTime class and count the total days, sort them, and subtract
the proper order to calculate the number of days.

Complete
Actual Time	2HH 50MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I learned about DateTime and how to sort date/time lines in Ruby. 
I encountered a problem with the DateTime at first but after some
trial and error, there was much rejoicing. I tested my program on both
the small and full git log files and achieved the same answers as was given
in the requirements documentation on the SE website.  I tested on my own git
log as well and can see how long I have been in the class, versus coding,
and it is interesting to see.
