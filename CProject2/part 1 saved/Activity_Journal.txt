SWEN-250 Project Activity Journal
C Health Monitoring System Project - Part 1

Name: Jon O'Brien

===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	1HH 20MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

     I will have to look up different ways of printing everything out.
In addition to that, I will have to print the different fields
in a way that is valid for the desired output.  I will have to 
lookup documentation on formatting more prints because this time
there are spaces in the fields, which have been different
that those we encountered in the past.


Complete
Actual Time	15HH 20MM
number of compiles: 65
ratio --> 11.5
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

     I learned to figure out many different ways of printing the csv
lines and many different ways to pass the information around
when dealing with pointers or addressing or passing the variables
to the print statement.  I had a lot of problems with the formatting
of the variables and passing everything properly.

===========  Stage 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	10HH 20MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

     I will have to look up documentation on structs of this type and 
add values in that manner, albeit with or without pointers.  I will
have to move the printing to another function for later usability
and reuse of code, following Meneely's DRY concept.

Complete
Actual Time	5HH 40MM
Number of Compiles: 40
ratio --> 0.55
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

     I had trouble with the printing. I had problems with the 
multiple accessing of the struct for each line and incrementing the
indices and properly storing and accessing the information from 
the struct with the proper information.  This ratio was reduced due
to the easiness of the level in respect to the prior ones.

===========  Stage 3  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	2HH 00MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

     For part 3 I will have to look up how to print according to id
and keep track of all the information to properly print everything.
To fully accomplish this part I will have to deal with the circular
buffer and I will also have to print according to a single patient
id, instead of just printing one single line and waiting for the next
index in the line to be printed.

Complete
Actual Time	2HH 00MM
Number of Compiles: 54
ratio --> 1.00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

     I was having problems with the circular buffer and the syntax
associated with that part of the code. The struct becomes more
and more complicated, the more I use it and the more things we have
to do to the part of the struct, the more difficult it becomes to
access the arrays and keep track of the information stored there.
The ratio did not cause any problems in this case, i performed
as I expected for this part.

===========  Stage 4  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	4HH 20MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

     For the fourth level of the project I will have to look up more info on
the struct becasue I am still having problems with the struct and addressing
the particular parts of the code that require me to use pointers and which 
requirements are needed for the multiple line handling by the print and adding functions.

Complete
Actual Time 2HH 10MM
Number of Compiles: 68
ratio --> .5
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

     The ratio here was reduced such that it was easier to complete 
this level than previous levels and achieve the proper completion for 
that level.  I had to deal with the circular buffer and deal with 
values that would exceed that buffer and cause me to reformat that 
such that it will not be exceeded and controlled in a safe manner 
for the code to deal with the 4th part.

===========  Stage 5  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	0HH 30MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

     I will just have to make small changes to format the code for multiple
patients. I will just have to add a couple for loops to change the 
index for the patient id and reassign the parameters being passed to 
my print function. I will have to ensure that the output is consistent 
across many tests and many different input types and patient 
numbers and criteria provided.

Complete
Actual Time	3HH 30MM
Number of Compiles: 82
ratio --> 7.00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

     I had problems with the EOF catching with my while loop.  
I think I was putting in the wrong loop and it kept messing up as I went.
I finally tried to resolve that iussue here, and you will see a lot of 
commented out attempted locations that I tried to use for the testing 
and proper printing.  The ratio spiked here and that was caused by 
the increase in bugs I created in the final part in my attempts to 
complete the project properly.

===========  PROJECT PART 1 SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================
     I found the project informative.  It attempted to have us learn about
pointers and addressing for a large part of the project, be it built in pointers
based on the scope, or the ones we explicitly defined.  I found the printing 
initially to be one of the hardest part, due to the pointers and the many different
parameters I had to think about as I struggled to grasp the initial struct
structure/layout.  I enjoyed the difficulty of the other levels, but I believe 4 and 5 
were made quite difficult in and off themselves becasue of the large changes you had to 
make to the initial code you started with.  my estimates for the code generally
decreased as I increased in efficiency and improved in my understanding of the project
but one drawback and one bug could have led to a huge decrease in my efficiency
and my time of completion was drastically reduced.

TOTAL ESTIMATED TIME: 18HH 30MM
TOTAL ACTUAL TIME:    28HH 40MM
RATIO: 1.55

(Replace this text with a couple of paragraphs summarizing your
experience with this project. What is too easy or too hard? What
was the most challenging technical problem you faced? How
did your estimated and actual time compare? Did your estimates
improve as you advanced to later stages? Why or why not?)
