C Health Monitoring System Project - Part 2

Name: Jon O'Brien

===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01HH 00MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

    For level 1 I will have to make an instance of the global chart
and then read and store the values from stdin to the instance.
I will then have to print out the values that were taken in and 
stored to complete the level.

Complete
Actual Time	  00HH 30MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

    Seeing as this level was pretty much the same level as it was for
the first part, I was able to redo it quickly, and I did not want
to just copy my code so that I could learn it better than that.

===========  Stage 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	02HH 00MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

    For this level I will have to connect in the health types to the
patients in the charts' buffer and then link that to the patientList
and charts accordingly. I will also have to take care to keep my
code readible and I go through this and complete things.

Complete
Actual Time	  01HH 00MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

    I was able to complete this level very quickly as I understood
the structs with much more knowledge than for the other parts and
for the first part of the project. I had problems with the initial
pointing but I think I was able to figure it out easily and it 
should be relatively similar for most of the functions in the 
health_util.c file, which was very straight forward.

===========  Stage 3  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	02HH 00MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

    I estimate that time for this level because I will have to
iterate to the next circular buffer and I will have to ensure I 
keep the ID's correct as I work with the input and the data taken. 
I will also have to keep track of the timestamps and the printing
may prove to be difficult if there are problems.

Complete
Actual Time	 02HH 00MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

    I learned about pointers some more and I learned that you need
to mess with some things to see just how they work to learn how to
manipulate the structs to get what you need from them.

===========  Stage 4  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01HH 30MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

    I think this level will be easy becasue it is just manipulating
the circular buffers and working with those as you traverse the
structs and complete this level.

Complete
Actual Time	  02HH 30MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

    I learned how to deal with the circular buffer and complete this
level with much ease.  I was having problems at first, but once I 
had a better understanding of the process involved, I completed
everything quickly.  I also had to have a better understanding of 
how to given structs worked in their linked fashion, and not as an
array with the chart ordering and which chart was in which position,
it was just in how they were input.

===========  Stage 5  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01HH 00MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

    I think this level will be easy, I will only have to modify the
circular buffer to accept multiple types, and use the struct to its
fullest potential. I will have to check it by printing many times
and confirming that I am doing what I want to do with the struct
and that everything is actually working.

Complete
Actual Time	  2HH 00MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

    I encountered a Segmentation Fault that I had to overcome with
an additional null check in the method I was working in and add
other checks in other methods to accommodate accordingly.

===========  Stage 6  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00HH 30MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

    I perceive this level as being quick as it only is an additional
couple edits in the struct and I believe that should be quite easy, 
but we shall see. I will have to keep to watching my nulls and proper
id numbers when I print so that I do not mess anything else up in the
formatting.

Complete
Actual Time	  01HH 30MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

    I learned how to work with the pointers and keep the patient id 
numbers intact when working with the struct and the charts accordingly.
I was also able to get the printing to be formatted as expected in the 
test given.  I believe my printing works as expected but I piped in
through a test file so I'm not sure if that will mess things up, I
thought the input given was confusing.


===========  Stage 7  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	3HH 00MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

    Since this level is last, and requires 2 additional methods, I
think it will take the longest, and I will probably have trouble with
the free() part and I'm not sure if I will be able to get it.

update: I tried things and I kept getting segfaults with direct input,
but when using my test files, after editing to move from level 6 to 7,
I received no errors anyway, but only through pasting lines directly
into ./health, but running my make tests didn't give me the errors.

update2: stuck, not working, have more important things to do, this is
only worth 5 points, so not a super huge deal breaker, not worth stressing over.

Actual Time	HH MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


===========  PROJECT SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================

total estimate: 8
total actual: 9.5
overall ratio: 9.5/8 = 1.2

    I enjoyed the project and I had an interesting time learning
through this method.  My ratio changed over time as I struggled with different 
levels of the project and I compensated with following levels with increased time
ratios and I either did better or worse than expected. The first level was quite easy.
I found level 7 very difficult and I was unable to complete it in the alloted time.
I als ohad a lot of problems with segfaults and I still don't know
why there are no errors shown when I pipe in the text file versus
just manually entering the lines and getting errors instead that way.
I also had difficulty understanding the structs layout at first, 
and that caused me some grief as I struggled to understand how
the whole setup worked.
