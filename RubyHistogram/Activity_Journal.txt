SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
Ruby - Histogram

Name: Jon O'Brien

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2HH 15MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
    I will go through the instructions to make small incremental additions to my code as I go.  I will check to ensure the code is working as I work and only commit working code.  I will test each part of the code as I work and print out different parts to ensure i am doing what is required.

Complete
Actual Time	5HH 30MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I had trouble with the sorting and alphabetical portions of the assignment, and I used the prints statements to work through the code and debug my code.  I used a lot of the ruby-docs to help me learn the syntax as well.
