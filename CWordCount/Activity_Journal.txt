SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
C - WordCount

Name: Jon O'Brien

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2HH 30MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

I will have to look online for documentation about the three libraries
referenced with the #include keyword at the beginning of the file.  I
will have to look up end of file documentation and how that works
in C with returning, and more documentation on getchar() and more
formatting for C lines as well.  I expect this assignment to be 
more difficult than our python or ruby inplementations because of
the way C handles strings as integers.

Complete
Actual Time	2HH 12MM
Number of compiles: 16
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I learned that I had to do everything in a single while loop that
was based on the EOF and changed the value of the characer that 
was being looked at as the loop progressed over the file to ensure
every character is looped over and assessed accordingly. The final
print statement was easy, now that formatting is becoming more 
common in our coding assignments. I will have to spend more time 
reading documentation and looking at examples online for better
understanding of the code and how it works in differnet situations.
