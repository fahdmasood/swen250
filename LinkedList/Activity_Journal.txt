SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
C - Linked List

Name: Jon O'Brien

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2HH 15MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

    I will have to look up documentation on malloc and pointers to
better understand how c does linked lists and allocates memory
to the nodes that I create in the linkedList.

Complete
Actual Time	4HH 15MM
Number of Compiles: 36
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

    I struggled with the initial bug of having the copylist return the
pointer and not knowing how to deal with that problem.  I fixed that
in class with Meneely telling everyone how to solve that problem and 
reassigning the head node and deleting the extra instances of head
and creating the copy() in main(). I had to deal with the obstacle
of the compiling and for some reason main wanted an integer to be
returned in main() but I fixed that by copying the files to a new folder
and recompiling and everything worked.
