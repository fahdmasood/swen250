SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
C - csv.c

Name: Jon O'Brien

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	4HH 30MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

I will have to look up structs and how to work with those
and I will have to look up how c handles character arrays and
passes parameters into other functions.  I will have to also look
up how to print based on csv fields and anything associated with 
that as well.

Complete
Actual Time	3HH 30MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I had some initial problems with working with the struct and I 
received some help from Tina on the initialization of the struct
for use in the code. I also had problems with formatting the 
print statements, and that took some work to get the min function
implemented into the print statements.
