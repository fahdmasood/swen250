Rails – Thought Share

Name: Jon O'Brien
**I rounded ratios up to nearest hundredth**
================================================================
Level 0 – Start
Estimated Time	0HH 30MM
Plan for this level:
          For this level I will have to setup the rails/ruby versions that are 
in the lab and then I will have to locate the files that are associated with 
the mistakes on the home page of the web application.  I will then look for the 
correct file associated with the button on the application, and the posts as 
well.  I will have to look more in-depth into interactions of the files and 
what is called, which files actually output to the application and how errors
are handled.  I will have to ensure that the proper version of rails is always
used when I run the rails commands and setup/seed/migrate things for this project.

Level 0 – Complete
Actual Time	0HH 40MM
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
           I had some difficulty installing rails and ruby versions that were 
equal to the lab versions. I resolved this with the bundle gem install/uninstall 
commands. Then I found I had to just run any rails command with the "bundle exec"
before the command so the correct version of the software could be used according
to the code denoted in the given files. The installation was not difficult at all,
it just took a couple tries to install/uninstall gems and the proper versions.

Level 0 - Ratio -> 1.33
     This ratio was caused by the installation of the software, and I would have
had the actual setup with the rake db:setup/seed was a relatively trivial process.
The spelling mistakes were found and I just had to reseed and refresh the page to
finish the corrections for this level, but it could have been faster if I had just
used a lab machine.

================================================================
Level 1 – Start
Estimated Time	1HH 10MM
Plan for this level:
          For this level I will have to look up validation checks for the input
from the user and check that versus regex statements or character lengths too.
I will have to lookup how to determine the proper syntax for this and how to
restrict character count, and the proper regex statements could be a time-
consuming as well.  The proper files will also have to be located and I will
have to make sure I am writing the lines in the proper files that actually
has the proper effects on the code and restricts user input.

Level 1 – Complete
Actual Time	1HH 30MM
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
          I learned how to work with the validation checks in rails and I'm
sure that that knowledge will help me later.  I encountered obstacles with the
exact syntax for the validation checks and the proper symbol names for the url or
the name that was associated with the formatting of the user input in regards to
the database and its' tables and columns, etc.

Level 1 - Ratio -> 1.29
     I was slowed by the url syntax for the regex.  I had to mess with the given
in order to make it work properly.  This proved tricky with the proper use of
colons and commas to denote the different symbols for the validations.

================================================================
Level 2 – Start
Estimated Time	0HH 30MM
Plan for this level:
          I plan on looking for the files associated with the mine button.
I have to determine how to differentiate between the different thinkers
and the thoughts that they made.  I will have to look at how the db gets
called and accessed for the button aspect of the application and the files
that are associated with that part of the application as well.

Level 2 – Complete
Actual Time	0HH 15MM
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
          I learned that the sorting is done is specific calls to the db and the 
db will give back certain thinkers or thoughts based on the call to the db.  I
had to figure out what to write based on the calls to the db and the debugging
for this part took me a little while to sort out the calls to the db.

Level 2 Ratio -> .50
    This part went quickly because I was able to find the files quickly
sort out what had to be changed to accommodate the small change in code that was
needed to sort the thoughts based on thinker relatively easily.  

================================================================
Level 3 – Start
Estimated Time	1HH 00MM
Plan for this level:
          I will have to figure out how to make the new method, determine if the
placement inside the file has a problem, and determine how to acquire the IDs of
the thinkers and thoughts that are associated with the new page that will be created
and then how to use the rails application to make the new page properly based on 
those findings and go from there. I will have to format the html page to keep the
same formatting and not have any code duplication, which could cause a problem if
that proves to be difficult.

Level 3 – Complete
Actual Time	1HH 30MM
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
           I learned that there was an error in the given match line, and I had
to switch the first set of :id and :action for the line to work properly.  This 
led me to be confused for some time as to why I did not see any changes being 
reflected in the application that was given and I wondered as to why none of my
code was working.  This obstacle was overcome and I had to resolve it with some
searching and messing around on the rails documentation pages.
		   
Level 3 Ratio -> 1.50
     This level took more time than expected because of the issues I encountered
with the rails commands on the command line.  I had to fumble around working
with the different commands because I had this installed on my laptop, working
with the different gems and getting the proper set to work, was confusing at 
first, but I recovered and finished the part.

================================================================
Level 4 – Start
Estimated Time	1HH 45MM
Plan for this level:
          For this part I will have to figure out what a database migration
actually does and how it works with all the files that were given and how to
ensure that I am working with the correct set of files as I work through this
level and complete the email additions to the application and input parts. The
validation checks will be easy with the regex being given, so I don't expect
any difficulties from that part.  The addition of the profile page may cause
problems but I hope that it will not give me too many obstacles.

Level 4 – Complete
Actual Time	2HH 30MM
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
          I encountered problems with the commands to migrate the database
and get it reseeded and resetup.  I did not know the process for completing
this step with the command line, and the steps required to rework the application
and fix the changed emails to work properly.  I encountered a lot of nil:nilClass
errors becasue of these changes not being fully implemented in rails with my 
migration not working properly.  I also had to go into the migration file and I did
not know that I had to edit code in there for a while too; I had to search for that
on the internet as well, checking documentation and the other migration files for
hints on the required changes.
		  
Level 4 Ratio -> 1.43
     This level took longer than expected because of the issues with the database 
commands and the error checking caused by that.  Once I resolved those issues, I
was able to finish the rest of the level with some speed that I could have had
a reversed ratio but was delayed due to a lack of conveyed knowledge, but I 
overcame that obstacle after some trial and error with the commands, restarting 
the server a few times, and testing that way.

================================================================
Level 5 – Start
Estimated Time	1HH 30MM
Plan for this level:
          For this level I will have to do some validation checking for the
uniqueness in the thumbers of a particular thought and ensure that the thumb 
is only added if the thinker has not thumbed the thought before, also ensuring
that the thinker is also unique.  This will probably involve some database
changes as well and I will probably have to look in multiple places to ensure
the validation is actually affecting what I want it to change and restrict at
both the top level and at the model level.
		  
Level 5 – Complete
Actual Time	1HH 00MM
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
          I was able to overcome the issue of validating uniqueness for the 
thumbers in such a way that no changes were name at the model level, as was
requested of in the requirements document, but that is ok as this fix was
relatively straight forward and was less work than expected.  I was able to
locate the file quickly and make a small change to accomplish this level 
and complete the requested modification to the model much faster than expected.

Level 5 Ratio -> .67
     This level took less time than expected due to the small amount of code
that was actually needed to be written for this part, just a small if statement
and some minor formatting changes.

================================================================
Overall Summary
Estimated Total Time   6HH 25MM
Actual Total Time	   7HH 25MM
Project Overall Ratio -> 1.17
     This project ratio changed over time as I completed more parts in more 
or less time than expected.  I would increase the time as I took longer for a
previous part or if I thought that the part would take a longer amount of time
because it had more parts to do in each level.  It shifted from far from 1 to 
closer to 1 dependent on the changes described above.  I can learn from this 
for later projects and have a better expectation of the time it will take for
me to complete future projects.

Project reflection:
     I learned some things from this project.  I learned how to manage my time
and how to look over the rails documentation for examples of the parts that I
was working on.  I think I became more proficient in Ruby, but only time will 
tell if this is true.  I think this project was moderately difficult, but I
was able to overcome my problems with help from the Internet and researching.
 I think you should give a hint that most of the rails code needed in the html
 page that you create is given in the other parts of the project, and you just
 have to search through the given files for the particular part you are writing
 rails code for and somewhere there is a given piece that you can paste in and
 it works for you.
