SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
Ruby - Factorial with Unit Testing

Name:

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2HH 30MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

I will follow the directions step by step.  I will only code when the 
directions say to write code.  I will run the tests to test the code 
as specified in the directions.



Complete
Actual Time	2HH 00MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I learned about unit testing in Ruby, how to raise assertions or equals as 
well as how to work with scripting in ruby.  I encountered problems with
checking for negatives and for strings, but this was overcome with the use
of if statements and simple checks for type.
