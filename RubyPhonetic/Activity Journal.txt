SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
Ruby - Phonetic
 
Name: Jon O'Brien
 
================================================================
Start
Estimated Time 3HH 20MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
 
I will go through the documentation and learn about 2d arrays and 
how ruby will handle them and how to access them using loops and 
indexing and other arrays to hold the keys and values associated with
the different dimensions of the array.  I will test all the functions 
and try multiple words, cases, and whether or not the translate properly
calls the other two functions.

Complete
Actual Time    6HH 50MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
 
 I learned to work more iteratively, go piece by piece or else you will
have a bad time trying to debug the code in attempts to fix indexing errors
and arrays not printing properly in ruby.  I learned the ruby way of ranges
and that helped with the for-loops I used and how to access the arrays.
