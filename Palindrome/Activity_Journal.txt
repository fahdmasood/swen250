SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
Python - Palindrome

Name: Jon O'Brien

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2HH 30MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

	I plan on having the file input working, then the removal
 of the whitespace and the non-letter characters. Then the 
program will iterate through the remaining characters and determine
palindromes.  I will compile after every few lines of new code to 
keep the code error-free, then commit to have good practice.

Complete
Actual Time	5HH 30MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

	I encountered problems with my personal laptop's wireless 
card not wanting to stay connected to the Wifi all the time, so 
that was slowing the process down, forcing me to commit more 
often to avoid having to constantly recover the corrupted file 
from a disconnected session.  Besides that, there was just syntax 
memory problems, from not using some features of python since 
last semester and the ins-and-outs of vim and the command line 
still being a little touchy.  The biggest problem I had was 
having the pointers properly being assigned, and having the lines
properly being read over by the program.
