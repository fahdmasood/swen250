SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
C - LongestLine

Name: Jon O'Brien

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	3HH 10MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

I will have to look up documentation for the from[] and readline 
function.  I will also have to look up what [] is actually defined
as in C and how to handle maxline counts of a file or a line being
input to the program.


Complete
Actual Time	1HH 20MM
Number of compiles: 15
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I learned about working with ctrl-d and passing arrays from one
function to another.  I had some difficulty with the eof originally
but I was able to overcome it and get the copying function to
work as expected.  I dealt with the character arrays and sending
the information from one function, to another without much
difficulty as I had with csv previously, but I believe it would
have been just as difficult this time as last time had I not
spent so much time before. Now that I am more familiar with these
types of problems, I hope that I will be able to complete things
much faster and bring my practicum grade up, as I need to do well
in order to pass the class with something I can live with.
These assignments help me to understand C and working with it
more and more I come to understand the syntax and how it works 
with all the different features including the preprocessor
and compile-time functions.
