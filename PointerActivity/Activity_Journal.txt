SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
C - Pointers

Name: Jon O'Brien

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time 2HH 30MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

I will have to loop up more information on pointers and C and more
ways of accomplishing past tasks with method that involve pointers
and all the aspects of the structs and pointing to the arrays and 
dereferencing properly. Pointers will be confusing to work with
and I will have to probably retry multiple steps to see the output
that I will be expecting.

Complete
Actual Time	2HH 30MM
Number of Compiles: 25
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I learned about addressing and dereferencing with pointers in this
assignment.  I was able to properly pass the pointers and address
arguments between functions and files as was the aim of this 
assignment.  I had some confusing moments about the proper way to
pass the pointer to the specified instance, but I was able to figure
everything out in the end.

The lack of given standard output examples leaves the solution quite
ambiguous for the completion of the assignment. I was able to have
the values print properly after being passed from stdin to the
functions and pointers and then reprint them after parsing the line.
