Python - Amino_Acids.py

Name: Jon O'Brien

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	1HH 30MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

    Use dictionaries to print strings of characters relating to rna codons.
Use scripts to test the python file according to the requirements of new
lines and characters to ignore.

Complete
Actual Time	2HH 09MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I worked on getting the three codons to calculate properly with the
looping over the lines and prointing properly after encountering a stop
codon and restarting when encountering a new start codon.
