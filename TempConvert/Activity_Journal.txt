SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
C - TempConvert

Name: Jon O'Brien

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	1HH 30MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

I will have to look up how to start the program, read the powerpoints
and determine how to format the strings.  I am going to have to look
up the different typing keywords and determine how C handles these
in regards to the strings and character handling.  I am also going to
have to look up the different ways that C handles justification of
lines and newlines, using formatting lines.

Complete
Actual Time	0HH 30MM
Number of times compiled: 15
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I learned how to define variables of different types in C and how
C handles these differently than other languages in regards to 
printing lines on the screen.  I learned how to format the lines
appropriately according to the requirements document and I was able
to quickly complete this assignment due to my efforts being more
focused than in the past.  I encountered a problem with the formatting
originally, but I was able to overcome this quickly with some googling
and completed this assignment quickly.
